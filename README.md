TurnBasedMultibox Addon - Usage Guide

(For Vanilla WoW 1.12)

This addon allows two characters to take turns executing slash commands (e.g., /swoosh for Rogues, /dribble for Druids) in a synchronized manner, using hidden addon messages to avoid chat spam.
ðŸ“Œ Setup Instructions
1. Install the Addon

    Place the TurnBasedMultibox folder in World of Warcraft\Interface\AddOns\

    Ensure both characters have the addon enabled

2. Configure Each Character
On Character 1 (Leader - Starts First)
lua
Copy

/tbm setpartner Character2Name  -- Set your partner's name
/tbm setslash SWOOSH           -- (or DRIBBLE, etc.)
/tbm setleader                 -- Designate as the starter

On Character 2 (Follower - Waits for Turn)
lua
Copy

/tbm setpartner Character1Name  -- Set your partner's name
/tbm setslash DRIBBLE           -- (or SWOOSH, etc.)

ðŸŽ® How to Use
Basic Commands
Command	Description
/tbm setpartner Name	Sets the other characterâ€™s name
/tbm setslash COMMAND	Sets which slash command to execute (e.g., SWOOSH, DRIBBLE)
/tbm setleader	Marks this character as the one who starts first
/tbm go	Executes your slash command when itâ€™s your turn
/tbm status	Shows current turn, role, and slash command
How Turns Work

    Leader (who ran /tbm setleader) goes first.

    After using /tbm go, the turn automatically passes to the partner after 2 seconds.

    The other character can then use /tbm go when prompted.

    Turns continue alternating until stopped.

ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting
Common Issues & Fixes
Issue	Solution
"Not your turn yet!"	Wait for the other character to finish their turn.
"Command not found"	Ensure the target addon (e.g., SWOOSH/DRIBBLE) is loaded.
Messages not sending	Both characters must be online and in the same zone.
Addon not working	Reload UI (/reload) and reconfigure.
ðŸ’¡ Tips

âœ… Works with any slash command â€“ Not just SWOOSH/DRIBBLE!
âœ… No chat spam â€“ Uses hidden addon messages.
âœ… Flexible timing â€“ Adjust WAIT_DELAY in the code if needed.
Example Workflow

    Rogue (Leader):

        /tbm setpartner MyDruid

        /tbm setslash SWOOSH

        /tbm setleader

        /tbm go (casts first, then passes turn)

    Druid (Follower):

        /tbm setpartner MyRogue

        /tbm setslash DRIBBLE

        Waits for turn notification, then /tbm go
